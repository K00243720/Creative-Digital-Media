    <h2>Taking on theory and practical</h2>
    <p> Taking on an ICT conversion course was a daunting task as a mature student, as I had little technical background, so a course in Creative Digital Media seemed a good way to combine technical skills with design theory. Given the scale of the IT sector and media environment and the current expansion of roles associated with both industries, I figured there is a good demand for graduates in Creative Digital Media. Having researched extensively and taking location into account, I decided Limerick Institute of Technology suited my purpose. The aim of the one-year conversion programme in Creative Multimedia Programming is a crash-course in all matters related to the creative digital media sphere. It aims to provide an academically-challenging experience that will develop the knowledge base, professional attitudes, project management skills and industry awareness needed to serve both the multimedia computing industry and society.</p>
    <p>I have found that the course also helps to cultivate a practical understanding of the interactive digital media industry and of project management, having regard to the importance of networking, team integration, knowledge management and the economic environment. As a result, I have been learning a lot in both the theory behind creative digital media and the practical skills necessary for its associated technologies and the management of information.</p>
    <p> The programme includes a mix of 3d graphics and animation, web development, database systems and design, interactive interface design, web programming, human cognition and communication and connected living with the Internet of Things. </p>
      
     <p>There are a number of modules in the programme</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3d Graphics</li>
