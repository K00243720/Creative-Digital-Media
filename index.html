    <h2>A back to education guide</h2>
    
    <p> Taking on an ICT conversion course was a daunting task as a mature student, as I had little technical background, so a course in Creative Digital Media seemed a good way to combine tehnical skills with design theory. Given the scale of the IT sector and media environment and the current expansion of roles associated with both industries, I figured there is a good demand for graduates in Creative Digital Media. Having researched extensively and taking location into account, I decided Limerick Institute of Technology suited my purposes. The aim of the one-year conversion programme is to provide an academically-challenging experience that will develop the knowledge base, professional attitudes, project management skills and industry awareness needed to serve both the multimedia computing industry and society.</p>
    <p>I have found that the course also helps to cultivate a practical understanding of the interactive digital media industry and of project management, having regard to the importance of networking, team integration, knowledge management and economic environment. As a result, I have been learning a lot in both the theory behind Creative Digital Media and the practical skills necessary for the management of information and its associated technologies.</p>
