      <h2>Interactive Interface Design</h2>
      <p>This module is about understanding what makes a good interface, by delving into usability and user experience. Both usability and user experience are extremely important in the world of Interaction Design. To do this we must better understand our users and so therefore, better understand the Human perception of the world around us. Interaction design means designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.</p>
